# Examples

The `examples` directory provides illustrative Rust programs demonstrating the usage of "Simple Rust." These examples are designed to showcase various features and common use cases of the library/application.

## Running an Example

To run an example, navigate to the root of the project and use the following Cargo command, replacing `example_name` with the name of the example you want to run:

```bash
cargo run --example example_name
```

## Available Examples

- **hello_world.rs**: Demonstrates basic usage.
- **advanced_feature.rs**: Showcases more complex functionalities.

## Adding New Examples

If you wish to contribute a new example:

1. Create a new Rust file in this directory.
2. Clearly comment the purpose of the example and provide adequate documentation.
3. Ensure the example is concise and focused on demonstrating specific features or use cases.

For more information on writing examples, see the [Rust Guidelines](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html).
