# Simple Rust

"Simple Rust" is a Rust-based project designed to simplify network operations and provide robust connectivity solutions. It features an easy-to-use API for establishing network connections and performing data transmission, making it ideal for developers working on networked applications or services. The project stands out for its straightforward approach to network programming, offering both efficiency and reliability, which could be particularly appealing for those dealing with complex networking requirements.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up a local copy of "Simple Rust" for development and testing. The project is structured to offer clear insight into Rust's networking capabilities, alongside benchmarking tools to evaluate performance. Whether you are looking to integrate Simple Rust into your application or contribute to its development, the following steps will help you get started:

1. **Clone the Repository:** First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

Ensure you have a recent version of Rust installed. You can install Rust with the following command:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. **Clone the Repository:** First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
https://github.com/yourusername/simple_rust.git
```

2. **Build the Project:** Navigate into the project directory and build the project using Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system:

```
cargo build
```

3. **Run Tests:** Ensure the network functionalities work as expected by running the included tests:

```
cargo test
```

4. **Explore Examples:** Dive into the `examples` directory to see Simple Rust in action. These examples demonstrate how to utilize the library for various network tasks.
```
cargo run --example <example_name>
```

By following these steps, you'll be able to set up Simple Rust for local

## Usage

### If Your Project is a Library

To use `YourProjectName` in your Rust project, add it to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
your_project_name = "0.1.0"
```

Import and use the library in your code like this:

```rust
// Import the library
use your_project_name::SomeModule;

fn main() {
    // Use a function from the library
    SomeModule::some_function();
    println!("Successfully used some_function from YourProjectName.");
}
```

Replace `SomeModule` and `some_function` with actual components from your library.

### If Your Project is an Application

After installing or building `YourProjectName`, you can use these commands to run the application:

```bash
# Run the application with default settings
your_project_name

# Display help information
your_project_name --help

# Run with specific options
your_project_name --option1 value1 --option2 value2

# Example: Process a file
your_project_name --process file.txt
```

Replace the example commands and options with those relevant to your application.
